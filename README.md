# A collection of experiments in responsive SVG
----------

This is a pool for several of my SVG experiments. I will put new stuff in here sometimes, maybe you want to check for new stuff from time to time.

Of course you can use all of the techniques demonstrated here freely. If you want to use the graphics, you must credit me.
